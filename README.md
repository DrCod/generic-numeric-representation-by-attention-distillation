Universal Numerical Representation by Attention Distillation

Introducing a novel approach for learning robust representation of numerical systems multilingually by leveraging auxillary weak supervision from semantically and lexically attentive signal distillation from a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence transliteration teacher model.
